💡 Project Number 39 : Predictive Maintenance of Industrial Machinery

--Problem Statement

Unexpected failures in industrial machinery cause costly downtime and impact productivity.
The challenge was to predict failures in advance using real-time sensor data to enable proactive maintenance.

--Solution Overview

An end-to-end machine learning solution was developed to classify different types of machinery failures such as:

-Tool Wear Failure

-Overstrain Failure

-Power Failure

-No Failure


Key features:

-Data Source: Kaggle Predictive Maintenance Classification dataset

-Approach: Data cleaning, feature engineering, model training with AutoAI

-Best Model: Snap Random Forest Classifier with 99.5% accuracy

-Deployment: IBM Watson Studio on IBM Cloud Lite as a REST API for real-time predictions



⚙️ Technology Stack
-Cloud Platform: IBM Cloud Lite

-AI/ML Tools: IBM Watson Studio, IBM AutoAI

Languages & Libraries:

-Python

-pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

-xgboost, tensorflow/keras (optional)

-ibm-watson-machine-learning, ibm-cos-sdk



🚀 Project Workflow

-Data Ingestion: Loaded Kaggle dataset into IBM Watson Studio

-Preprocessing: Handled missing values, normalized data, engineered relevant features

-Model Building: Ran AutoAI to train and rank models; Random Forest selected as the best pipeline

-Evaluation: Achieved 99.5% accuracy, validated with Precision, Recall, F1-Score

-Deployment: Deployed as an online web service on IBM Cloud Lite

-Testing: API endpoint tested with sample inputs, confirming real-time classification



📊 Results
-Accuracy: 99.5%

-Confidence Levels: 96–100% across all predictions

-Outcome: Reliable multiclass classification for predictive maintenance, enabling early intervention and cost savings
